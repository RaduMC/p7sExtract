# p7sExtract

A simple extractor for digitally signed p7s files, a format based on PKCS #7 and commonly used in documents uploaded for public tenders.
The advantage over official viewers is that it can batch process multiple files.

Since the p7s format is not well documented, I reverse engineered the file structure and tested it on several hundred samples.
